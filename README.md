Webpack 2 + TypeScript starter
---

This is by far no sophisticated starter or whatever. The goal is to get the simplest possible setup to get you started with Webpack 2 and TypeScript. You can then start from here and add further stuff you need, such as SASS compilation, add framework specific stuff etc.

Also check out the official Webpack 2 docs for a proper TypeScript setup: https://webpack.js.org/guides/webpack-and-typescript/

_Note, this is still a WIP. Contributions/suggestions are welcome :smiley:_

## How to use

Just clone it and get going.

```
$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:juristr/webpack-typescript-starter.git
```

Maybe remove the `.git` directory and start with a fresh one.

## Contributions

Of course! Open an issue and let's discuss :smiley:.
